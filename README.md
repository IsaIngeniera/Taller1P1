##  About the Project
This project is a web application developed using **Django**. It serves as a personalized movie directory where users can explore a curated collection of films and search for specific titles.

### Key Functionalities:
* **Home Page**: A modern, aesthetic interface displaying movies in a responsive 2x2 grid.
* **Search Engine**: A functional search bar that filters movies from the database in real-time.
* **About Page**: A dedicated section with project details and a "waiting" status clock.

##  Frontend & Design Credits
The visual identity of this project was a major focus. I utilized **Bootstrap 5** to create a clean, "girly/aesthetic" interface with a soft pink color palette and uniform image proportions.

> **Note:** I collaborated with **Gemini** to enhance the Home page design and polish the frontend experience, ensuring a professional and user-friendly layout.

##  Technologies Used
* **Backend:** Python & Django
* **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 (Responsive Design)
